Executive Summary
=================
*// SOMEONE MAKE THIS BETTER*
This report presents the definition, analysis, and design of an improved information system solution for the call management centre (CMC) of a major travel company. The Design Thinking principles and agile methodology (Scrum) used are discussed, and iterative progress is documented on GitHub.


Problem Definition
==================
* The current Call Management Centre provides suboptimal:
  * Waiting times
  * RM to customer matching (mismatch)
  * Prioritisation of customers
  * Inbound call costs
* The Call Management Centre currently provides a suboptimal user experience, due to wait times and poor customer-RM matching, leading to user disatisfaction

## **Objectives**
* Develop an information to improve operation of the Call Management Centre
* Adjust call flow-rate to Relationship Managers
* Improving profitability and customer satisfaction
* Match RMs and end-customers according to RMs skills and customer profiles

## **Assumptions**
 5. List assumptions you have made in the systems analysis.

## **List of Stakeholders**

Stakeholders refer to individuals/entities that have an interest in the development of an information system. The key stakeholders of this project are:

* Customers
* Relationship Managers (RMs)
* Travel Company

## **Point of View (POV) Statements**

### Customers
* Customers calling the travel company need to  have their call answered in a timely manner because current situation has customers waiting on the phone with no RM callback
* Customers speaking to a Relationship Manager need to be  matched with an RM who has the required language proficiency because current situation has customers being inadequately paired with RMs who don’t meet skill/language requirements.
* Customers with little travelling experience need to  call an RM capable of assisting them in finding a package to suit their needs because in the current situation, some customers are finding imperfect packages due to inadequate RM matching

### Travel Company
* Travel Company managing RM staff need to determine which staff members are underperforming in  regards to reaching their KPIs because current situation doesn’t have a system with the capabilities of KPI tracking
* Travel Company managing incoming calls need to manage incoming calls so that no additional call costs impact company budget because the current situation doesn’t have a system which effectively manages incoming calls without causing unforeseen impacts to potential end-users 
* Travel Company managing customer relations need to improve CMC operation and call flow rate because currently, customers are complaining about wait times
* Travel Company managing customer relations need to To profile RMs because RMs are not being matched effectively with customers being served

### Relationship Managers
* Relationship Managers need to serve customers that match their skill set and knowledge because in the current situation, some RMs do not have the required knowledge to best server calling customers
* Relationship Managers need the system to provide guidelines and script for outbound calls to ensure quality best customer service because in the current situation there is not a defined way for how to approach these calls
* Relationship Managers need to have an established profile (depending on the age, sex, culture, language proficiency, experience and product knowledge) because in the current situation, customers are allocated based on RM’s expertise

Design Thinking Approach
========================
*3. Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective. Your Design Thinking approach to address the problem with artefacts*

## **Brainstormed Ideas and Reflection**
*TODO*

## **How Might We (HMW) Statements**

### End-Customer
* HMW better reach customers who have been on hold for an extended period of time.
* HMW better match customers to RMs so they have a high quality of customer service.
* HMW better match RMs with customers so they can find perfect packages.
* HMW prevent customers from hanging up.
* HMW better communicate with customers to lock down deals within a minimal call time.

### Relationship Managers
* HMW profile RMs, so they are matched effectively to customers served.
* HMW match more knowledgeable RMs to specific customers.
* HMW better allocate customers based on RM expertise

### Travel Company
* HMW monitor KPIs.
* HMW manage incoming calls so that they do not add additional costs to the travel company by occupying human resources (Relationship Managers).

Potential Advantages and Disadvantages
======================================
7. (around 500 words) Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information system. E.g. Potential benefits to the call center (in terms of reducing cost and being able to carry out more effective calls). Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information system project fails. 

## **Competitive Advantage**
Developing this new information system, if successful, will lead to a plethora of competitive advantages against other major travel companies looking to increase their customer loyalty or retention. Currently, the major travel company involved is in a great position in the market but has some areas that it is lacking in. For example, the CMC (Call Management Centre) has reduced operating efficiency due to call flow control and call routing issues. This leads to some customers having long wait times and drives up the inbound call cost of the CMC. Through the information system, these areas could be improved and provide many advantages.

If the call flow control and routing issues are removed or even lessened through the development of the new information system, then customers will have shorter wait times as well as more effective matches with RMs (Relationship Managers). This increase in user experience will improve customer retention, as they see changes being made in the system for their benefit. In addition, implementing an easier method of feedback elicitation for future, subpar areas could lead to a large uptake in customer loyalty due to their voices being heard and taken into consideration. This will also inadvertently put greater risk on competitors to keep up, which is an extraordinary competitive advantage.

From a more business-centric point of view, not only will the customers be happier with the system, but the travel company will also save costs in handling the soon-to-be larger customer base. The information system's ability to reduce per-call handling time will reduce the cost of inbound calls to the CMC. This, in combination with the increased income that comes with a greater amount of customers, will even further extend the profit of the travel company.

## **Possible Effects of Project Failure**
If the information system is ineffective, lacklustre or fundamentally useless, there are some considerable adverse effects to first take into account. Ranging from the loss of customers, as opposed to sharp gain, to increased operating costs for no benefit, the adverse effects possible should be weighed into consideration alongside the competitive advantages to most accurately see the possible result of the information system.

By implementing what the travel company believes is a solution to their biggest issues, and communicating to users as such, there is an inherent risk if we fail to deliver. By producing a suboptimal solution, customers may feel rightly disappointed, as their expectations were not met. Particularly if these issues have been ongoing for some time, customers who thought the end of these issues were near may be especially upset and cease their interactions with the travel company. Not only does this result in fewer profits for the company, but customers will most likely still need their services met and will hence move to one of the company's direct competitors - a huge competitive disadvantage.

Not only this, but if the system does not work as intended, then the increase in operations (more tasks are performed as a result of the information system) may in fact work against the CMC and slow its efficiency, for little to no reward. This would produce a compounded negative effect, wherein not only is the CMC slower but it is expected to be faster. As such, the lengthened wait times and reduced call flow handling would ultimately lead to greater inbound call costs.
