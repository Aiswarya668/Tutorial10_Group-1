Relationship Managers
 - Want to be paired with customers where they have the suitable knowledge and requirements to make a sale

 - Want a customer rating system so that customers who are more likely to buy and have money to splurge on holidays and who are loyal customers are prioritised 
 - Want a way to take messages on missed calls so that we don't miss out on the sale just because they called at a busy time
 - Want recognition and rewards for serving customers efficiently and effectively (performance statistics recorded by the system)
 
Customers
 - Want to be patched through to a sales person that has the right language proficiency so that unecessary blockers are removed, making the customer wait less on the phone

 - Want to be able to book a holiday at the comfort of my home
